# Information-Retrieval-System-using-Apache-Lucene-in-JAVA

This is a command-line based Inforamtion Retrieval System built in JAVA using Apache Lucene search library [^1].

+ Using Lucene, it parses and indexs Plain Text and HTML documents that a given folder and its subfolders contain. Also, all parsed files are listed.
+ English language is considered to Stem (e.g. using Porter Stemmer).
+ A search index is selected or a new one is created (if not available in the chosen directory).
+ User can choose the ranking model with keywords as; Vector Space Model (VS) or Okapi BM25 (OK).
+ A ranked list of relevant articles given a search query are printed. The output contains the 10 most relevant documents with their rank, relevance score, file name resp. title (if it is a HTML-file containing title information) and the path.
+ Multiple fields are concurrently searched (multifield search): not only the documentâ€™s text (body tag) are searched, but also its title.
